# stickyMenu.github.io
In this project, the navigation bar becomes sticky as soon as it reaches the top position, so that user does not have to go to the back again, in case of a long page, in order to reach the navigation menu. I have used front-end web development technologies like, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
